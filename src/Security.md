The security model implemented by the Inception framework supports both role-based and function-based security.

Access to application functionality can be assigned to a user by:
 
* Assigning a user to a group that is linked to a role that has direct access to the functionality e.g. assigning the user to the Administrators group, which is assigned the Administrator role.
* Assigning a user to a group that is linked to a role that has the appropriate functions linked to it to allow function-based access e.g. assigning a user to the Organization Administrators group, which is linked to the Organization Administrator role, which in turn is assigned the Security.UserAdministration function.
